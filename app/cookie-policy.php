                <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>

                <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny
                    files
                    that are
                    downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they
                    gather, how I use it
                    and why I sometimes need to store these cookies. I will also share how you can prevent these
                    cookies
                    from being stored
                    however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites functionality.</p>

                <p>For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">HTTP Cookies</a>...</p>

                <h2>How I Use Cookies?</h2>

                <p>I use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases there are no
                    industry standard
                    options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add
                    to
                    this site. It is
                    recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case
                    they
                    are used to
                    provide a service that you use.</p>

                <h2>Disabling Cookies</h2>

                <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser
                    Help
                    for how to do
                    this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites
                    that you visit.
                    Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of this
                    site.
                    Therefore
                    it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.</p>

                <h2>The Cookies I Set</h2>


                <p>To provide you with a great experience on this site I provide the functionality to set your
                    preferences
                    for
                    how this site runs when you use it. To remember your preferences I need to set cookies so that this
                    information can be called whenever you interact with a page is affected by your preferences.</p>

                <h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>

                <p>In some special cases I also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section
                    details which third
                    party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>

                <p>This site uses Google Analytics, which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution
                    on
                    the web for
                    helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that I can improve your experience. These
                    cookies may track
                    things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so I can continue to
                    produce
                    engaging
                    content.</p>

                <p>For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the official <a
                        href="https://www.google.co.nz/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> page.</p>

                <p>From time to time I test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered.
                    When I are still
                    testing new features these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience
                    while
                    on the site
                    while ensuring I understand which optimisations our users appreciate the most.</p>

                <p>I also use social media buttons and/or plugins on this site that allow you to connect with your
                    social
                    network in
                    various ways. For these to work the following social media sites including; LinkedIn, Facebook and
                    Twitter, will set
                    cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or contribute to
                    the
                    data they hold for
                    various purposes outlined in their respective privacy policies.</p>


                <h2>More Information</h2>

                <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
                    that
                    you aren't sure
                    whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with
                    one of
                    the features
                    you use on our site. However if you are still looking for more information, then you can contact us
                    through one of our
                    preferred contact methods.</p>
